Fall 2021

# Project 1
- Developed two routing schemes using BFS and DFS to traverse a 3-D coordinate system
- Built solution incrementally using backtracking

 # Project 2 - Part A 
- Zombie Gameplay in which the player operates in 'rounds'
- Used priority queues implemented through different comparators 
- Makes use of dynamic memory allocation with necessary destructors 
- Facilitated efficient interactions among different data structures (i.e., a Master-container of Zombie pointers &amp; PQ subset of Zombies)

# Project 2 - Part B
- Implemented a sorted heap, binary heap, and pairing (fibonacci) heap
- Implemented an interface that uses templated "generic" code
- Used inheritance and basic dynamic polymorphism 

# Project 3
- Designed an executable program in which users can interactively identify the important/relevant entries of their log file
- Evaluated the runtime and storage tradeoffs for storing and accessing data contained in multiple data structures.

# Project 4
- Implemented Prim's Minimum-Spanning-Tree (MST) algorithm 
- Used an arbitrary insertion heuristic for achieving a nearly-optimal Traveling-Salesperson (TSP) solution as fast as possible
- Developed a fast and effective branch and bound algorithm to optimally solve TSP
- Used gnuplot for visualization
